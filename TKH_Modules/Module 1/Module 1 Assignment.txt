1.) In your own words explain at its core what a computer really is doing whenever you type a letter on a keyboard (250 words)?
Processes data using computer resources like hardware and software can be broken into four steps; input, process, output and storing. Before a computer can process anything, data must receive input. For example, typing on a keyboard can enter input into the computer. As you input information into the computer, at the lowest level, all the computer understands is binary language (0's and 1's). See our binary and machine language pages for further information about how binary works. After a computer has received input data, a program is used to process that information. A typical program may calculate, manipulate, or organize the data to create information that is understandable and presentable to the user. After the data is processed into information, it is displayed as output to the user.
A real life example data being processed into information, imagine the following scenario. You open the game Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. on your computer as select 'start' and hit the 'enter' key on the keyboard, the computer process this input and execute the game code to begin to the game.
 The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each time they reach a screen edge as the alien row move downwards the player moves either left/right using the keyboard. on hitting 'left'/ 'right' on the keyboard the computer process this input and moves the player icon accordingly which is then displayed on the screen . While the player has three lives, the game can paused during play in this case the computer stores the users data and suspend the session and can be continued until the player runs out of lives of destroys the aliens.



2.) Explain in your own words what is a packet of data (300 Words)
Communication is established over a network when information is able to be sent from one side to the other. In order for this process to happened this information is sent over the network in the form of a data packet. A packet defined as basic unit of communication that is packaged for transmission over a packet switched network. The term PDU is used to refer to the packets in different layers of the OSI model. The PDU has a different meaning in different layers still we can use it as a common term;
- The PDU of Transport Layer is called as a Segment.
- The PDU of Network Layer is called as a Packet.
- The PDU of the Data-Link Layer is called Frames.
- The PDU of the Physical Layer is called Bits.
_ The PDU in Layer 5 and above is referred to as Data.
The structure of the packet depends on the type of packet it is and on the protocol. Normally, a packet has a header and a payload. The header keeps overhead information about the packet, the service, and other transmission-related data. For example, data transfer over the Internet requires breaking down the data into IP packets, which is defined in IP (Internet Protocol), and an IP packet includes:
- Source IP address: the IP address of the sending device.
- Destination IP address: the IP address of the device to which the data is sent.
- Sequence number of the packets: a number that puts the packets in order such that they are   reassembled in a way to get the original data back exactly as it was prior to transmission.
- The type of service Flags
And some other technical data
-The payload, which represents the bulk of the packet (all the above is considered as overhead), and is actually the data being carried.


3.) Explain Data Rate, Throughput and Bandwidth” (200 Words)
Data rates:  generally measured in kilobits per second (kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps).it is the rate at which data is transmitted through a network over time. This measure of speed while common in all network layers also defines the speed at data is transferred from one device to another or between a peripheral device and the computer. Bandwidth: Is an indication the maximum/minimum capacity of data that can be transferred over a path/link in a specific period. It is a physical layer property in the OSI model and does not depend on the properties of the sender or receiver. it generally measured in bits per second(bps), Megabits per second (Mbps) or Giga bits per second(Gbps).Throughput: refers to the overall effective transmission rate, determined by how many packets arrive at their destinations successfully, also called as effective data rate or payload rate. For example, when you open a tap, throughput can be said to be the total amount of water that comes out while is on. It can be easily affected by change in interference, traffic in network, network devices, transmission errors and the host of other type. For the most part, throughput capacity is measured in bits per second, but it can also be measured in data per second.
 


4.)Explain in your own words Datagram Forwarding: ( 250 Words)
An IP packet is called a datagram and IP datagram consists of a header followed by a data area. A datagram-forwarding model of packet delivery, packet headers contain a destination address. It is up to the intervening switches or routers to look at this address and get the packet to the correct destination.
In datagram forwarding this is achieved by providing each switch with a forwarding table of ⟨destination,next_hop⟩ pairs. When a packet arrives, the switch looks up the destination address (presumed globally unique) in its forwarding table and finds the next_hop information: the immediate-neighbor address to which – or interface by which – the packet should be forwarded in order to bring it one step closer to its final destination. The next_hop value in a forwarding table is a single entry; each switch is responsible for only one step in the packet’s path. However, if all is well, the network of switches will be able to deliver the packet, one hop at a time, to its ultimate destination.
The “destination” entries in the forwarding table do not have to correspond exactly with the packet destination addresses, though in the examples here they do, and they do for Ethernet datagram forwarding. However, for IP routing, the table “destination” entries will correspond to prefixes of IP addresses; this leads to a huge savings in space. The fundamental requirement is that the switch can perform a lookup operation, using its forwarding table and the destination address in the arriving packet, to determine the next hop.


5.)Explain Algorithms in your own words (250 Words)
Simply put, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. A set of inputs and produces that is used to achieve the desired output. In computing, an algorithm gives the computer a specific set of instructions, which allows the computer to do everything; a computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to execute, in what specific order, to carry out a specific task. Some types of algorithms include but not limited to: Divide and conquer algorithms, Brute force algorithms, Greedy algorithms, Recursive algorithms, Backtracking algorithms, Dynamic programming algorithms, etc. Algorithms are written using particular syntax, depending on the programming language being used. In some complex situation, writing an algorithm can be very time-consuming as you try to come up with the best possible solution to a task, also branching and Looping statements may too be difficult to clearly represent in an algorithm. Some qualities of Good Algorithms are: 
•	Clear and Unambiguous: Input and output should be defined precisely.
•	Well-Defined Inputs & output: the definition is the input must be clear and the output should yield well- defined output.
•	Finiteness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e., it should have a beginning and an end.
•	Feasible: The algorithm must be simple, generic, and practical, such that it can be executed upon will the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything.
•	Language Independent: The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e., shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in plain and easy to understand language and yet the output will be same, as expected.



6.) Explain network topology. (250 words).
Network topology : refers to the manner in which devices (nodes) on a network are arranged to relate to each other. Topologies are categorized as either physical network topology - defining the placement of the various components of a network and how data ia transmitted through the interconnected wires and cables between, or logical network topology - which refers to the mechanism that defines how data communicates through the nodes on the network, independent of physical connection between these nodes. Logical topology deals with network protocols that are used to control the data flow, twisted pair Ethernet, which is categorized as a logical bus topology, and token ring as a logical ring topology. It helps to design the initial structure of the network and if any change is where it can be done before implementing the network physically. Physical network topology examples include star, mesh, tree, ring, point-to-point, circular, hybrid, and bus topology networks, each consisting of different configurations of nodes and links. The ideal network topology depends on each business’s size, scale, goals, and budget. A network topology diagram is a visual representation of a network’s devices, connections, and paths, allowing you to picture how devices are interconnected and how they communicate with one another. The layout of a network has a direct impact on network functionality. Selecting the right topology can improve performance and data efficiency, optimize allocation of resources, and reduce operational costs. Software-created network topology diagrams are important references for diagnosing network connectivity problems, investigating network slowdowns, and generally troubleshooting issues.
